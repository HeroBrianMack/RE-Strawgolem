# Straw Golem Rebaled Updated 
This mod adds a helpful and pretty adorable little golem to do some of your farming for you. It can harvest, replant and deliver crops to a nearby storage.
To download, head on over to either [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/straw-golem-rebaled-ported) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/straw-golem-rebaled-updated).
- It's available for Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge, each at the same stage of development.
- This mod, made for Minecraft 1.21+ (1.20 versions still exist [here](https://github.com/HeroBrianMack/strawgolem) but won't receive major updates at this moment), is a spiritual successor to the spirtual successor (now say that three times fast) of the now unavailable [original](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/strawgolem) Straw Golem mod, built for Minecraft 1.12.

## Getting Started
To create a Straw Golem, stand near the crops or farm where you want it to do its thing. Then place a carved pumpkin on top of a hay bale. (Or carve a pumpkin that is already on a hay bale).
After you stare into the abyss that is its eyes for long enough, it will stare back and begin to harvest crops!

## Storage Usage
Once a Straw Golem harvests a crop, it will seek out somewhere to store the item. Thus, a chest or other storage block should be placed near the crops where the golem does its work, and you should make sure the chest have available space inside to hold the soon-to-be harvested crops. 
- Your golem is usually clever enough to locate an available storage on its own. 
- If you have more than one storage in the vicinity, the golem will choose one on its own.
- You can designate the storage for a golem to use by shift right clicking on the golem, and then doing the same on a storage.
- The golem will use it as long as it's within the golem's range. [See Config](https://github.com/HeroBrianMack/RE-Strawgolem/new/master?filename=README.md#config)

## Golem Life
- You can dress up your golem with a dapper straw hat.
- As your golem gets more and more damaged, it will begin to break down (only visually currently).
- You can treat decay by feeding the golem wheat while making it very happy.
- Straw golems are easily bored, and they will begin wandering if they have nothing better to do.

## Config
The mod is made to be fairly configurable, with more configuration options planned in the future.
- You can customize the range that straw golems are willing to search to find crops and chests.
- You can also whitelist or blacklist crops as well!

This mod should work with most modded crops without any modification, if there are any mods where it doesn't let me know and I will fix it quickly!
